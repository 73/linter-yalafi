# `linter-yalafi` - Checks your LaTeX documents

`linter-yalafi` is an [Atom](https://atom.io) package that lints LaTeX documents with respect to grammar and spelling using [LanguageTool](https://languagetool.org). To filter any LaTeX commands [YaLafi](https://github.com/matze-dd/YaLafi) is used.

# Installation
Using the Atom package manager:

`apm install lint-yalafi`

You also have to install [linter](https://atom.io/packages/linter):

`apm install linter`

Since this is an interface to YaLafi it also has to be installed. The easiest way is to use `pip`:

`pip install yalafi`
